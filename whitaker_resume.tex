\textbf{University of Washington eScience Institute}, Seattle, WA \hfill \textbf{June 2013 -- present} \\\vspace{-4mm}
\textsl{Research Scientist} \\
\begin{list2}
\item Contributed to the Myria project for big data analytics: design and implementation of the MyriaL query language, which combines SQL-like functionality with iteration; a framework for testing queries against a ``fake'' database implementation; various rule-based optimizations (selection pushing, etc.); simple user-defined functions; database operators for set intersection, file scan; HDFS integration.
\item Wrote Hadoop Map/Reduce routines for parsing and analyzing the ClueWeb12 web snapshot: 
\url{https://github.com/7andrew7/ClueParse}.
\item Wrote Spark routines for analyzing a geographic call log distribution.
\item Wrote SQL queries for extracting biological ``interologs'' from a database of protein interactions:

\textsl{Senior Software Engineer} \\
\begin{list2}
  \item Contributed to various potions of the Jinx hypervisor: APIC
    virtualization, paging,  HPET timers, TSC emulation, MSR emulation, and
    FPU virtualization.
  \item Designed Jinx's thread scheduling and synchronization primitives
  \item Implemented an algorithm for deterministic multiprocessor scheduling
  \item Co-developed the Jinx Linux port
  \item Contributed to a thread causality tracker based on vector clocks
  \item Implemented support for wide floating point registers on Sandybridge processors
  \item Created various ``bug benchmarks''  for evaluating Jinx
  \item Built a prototype data race detector
  \item Performed numerous demonstrations of Jinx to potential customers
